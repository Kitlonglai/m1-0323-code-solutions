## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
To run a task/ code many times.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
To test if a condition is true in order to execute the statement and the loop.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
An iteration is one complete cycle of a loop executing the code in its block.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
Right before the while loop begins.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
At the beginning of the loop before the execution of the code block, in which a variable is declared and created and is most often the counter.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
After the initialization expression executes, which checks the counter of the loop.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
At the end, when both the initialization and condition expressions are executed along with the code block.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
Break.
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
Increments the loop counter by 1.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
Using a for...in loop and statement to get the key in the object (const key in object).
