## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
Block of code used to perform a task where it takes an input and returns and output.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
function keyword, name of function, parameters, function statement, opening and closing curly brace for function code block
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
Writing the name of the function and placing parentheses next to it, with your arguments in side the parentheses seperated by commas.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
The function definition defines the name of the function, its parameters and the code block to be ran. The function call is outside the function definition code block and only consists of the name of the function and its argument in parenthesis.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
A parameter is called in the function code block when the function is declared and an argument is used when the function is called outside the function code block.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
Parameters are useful for holding the value of the argument when the code block is ran.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
Causes the function to produce a value we can use and prevents any more code from being ran.
