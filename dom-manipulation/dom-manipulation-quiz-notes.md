using the className property on the element followed setting the value of new text content

- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
using the textContent property on an element followed by setting the value of new text content
- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
not always because sometimes when a function is called, we do not need to access the event or its properties, we can use an empty function call
- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?
more complicated as we wouldn't have a counter for clicks, which would mean not being able to activate the css

makes it easier to view data in your code and for easier testing
